  <title>FAQ</title>

 <body>

Can I withdraw skins right after depositing?
</br>
If you never played on our site before then you won't be able to withdraw without playing on our site due to the Anti-Trade System.
</br>
What is Provably Fair?</br>

Provably fair is a way of generating random numbers using cryptography such that the results can be verified by a third party. This means the operators cannot manipulate the outcome of any roll. In short, we use the results of a state run lottery to seed our RNG (random number generator).
</br>The site is in the BETA stage, so some functions may not work.
</br>We are not responsible for the items placed on the site! (Deposit)</br>
Rules can change at any time without alerting users!
